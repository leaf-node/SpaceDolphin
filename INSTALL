SpaceDolphin

This is a simple 2D game released under GPLv3+. It uses the Chipmunk Physics
engine, which is also free software. (meaning these respect your freedom.)

Pre-build Instructions:

SDL, cairo, git and CMake need to be installed to build and run this game.
The following command will install these packages for you in an apt-based
packaging system, used by many distros of GNU/Linux: (Pacakge names may be
different in newer or older systems.)

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libsdl1.2-dev libcairo2-dev

Next, you need to grab the source code, if you haven't downloaded it yet. (The
clone only needs to be done once):

    git clone https://gitlab.com/spacedolphin/spacedolphin.git

    cd spacedolphin


Build Instructions:

To build the game in the spacedolphin directory, run:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

CMake will automatically build and statically link the included Chipmunk
Physics library, without needing to install it.

In the future, you can pull the changes to update the source code:

    git pull
    cd build
    make

See the README file to learn about how to play the game.
