(The clone only needs to be\r\ndone once):\r\n\r\n    git clone https://sudoman@github.com/sudoman/SpaceDolphin.git\r\n    cd SpaceDolphin\r\n\r\nIn the future, you can pull the changes to update the source code:\r\n\r\n    git pull\r\n\r\nTo build the game in the SpaceDolphin directory, run:\r\n\r\n    mkdir build ; cd build\r\n    cmake ..\r\n    make\r\n\r\nCMake will automatically build and statically link the included Chipmunk\r\nPhysics library, without needing to install it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Game Instructions\r\n\r\nTo play the game, run this:\r\n\r\n    ./spacedolphin\r\n\r\nControl your flight with the arrow keys so that you can knock objects around\r\nthe screen.
