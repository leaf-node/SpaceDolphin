This is the source code to Chipmunk Physics v 6.1.3, but with the Demos
removed. I've also changed the CMakeLists.txt files to contain only what is
necessary to build this particular project.

If you want to play with demos, or want to build the dynamic library, visit the
program's home page:

And thanks, Howling Moon Software! :)
