This is a simple little toy game released under GPLv3+. It uses the Chipmunk
Physics engine, which is under a permissive license.


-->  Build Instructions:

SDL, SDL_gfx and cmake need to be installed to build and run this game. The
following command will install these packages for you in an apt-based packaging
system, used by many distros of GNU/Linux: (Pacakge names may be different in
newer/older systems.)

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-4 libsdl-gfx1.2-dev

To build the game, run:

    make

It should automatically download and build the Chipmunk Physics library, so you
no longer have to go out of your way to install it manually. Of course, you'll
need an internet connection (or to copy the "ChipmunkLatest.tgz" file into the
"dl" subdirectory) to proceed.

To play the game, run this:

    ./spacedolphin


--> Game Instructions

Control your flight with the arrow keys so that you can knock objects around
the screen. Go nuts with it.
