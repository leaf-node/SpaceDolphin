This is a simple little toy game released under GPLv3+. It uses the chipmunk
physics engine, which is under a permissive license.


**This is not the master branch.**
You probably want to use that one instead because it uses a faster graphics
library. This branch uses cairo, which draws slightly prettier graphcs.


-->  Build Instructions:

SDL and cairo need to be installed to build and run this game. This command
will install those libraries for you in an apt-based packaging system, used by
many distros of GNU/Linux: (Pacakge names may be different in newer/older
systems.)

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2debian libsdl1.2-dev libcairo2 libcairo2-dev

You will also need to have the dynamic library for Chipmunk installed. I
recommend Chipmunk 6.0.3 or later. You do not need to build the demos included
with Chipmunk.

    http://chipmunk-physics.net/release/ChipmunkLatest.tgz

Once that is installed, come back here and execute make:

    make

To play the game, run this:

    ./spacedolphin


--> Game Instructions

Control your flight with the arrow keys so that you can knock objects around
the screen. Go nuts with it.
