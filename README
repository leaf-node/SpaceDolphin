This is a simple little toy game released under the GPLv3+. It uses the
Chipmunk Physics engine, which is under a permissive license.


Build Instructions:

SDL, SDL_gfx, and CMake need to be installed to build and run this game. The
following command will install these packages for you in an apt-based packaging
system, used by many distros of GNU/Linux: (Pacakge names may be different in
newer or older systems.)

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev

To build the game in the SpaceDolphin directory, run:

    mkdir build ; cd build
    cmake ..
    make

CMake will automatically build and statically link the included Chipmunk
Physics library, without needing to install it.


Game Instructions

To play the game, run this:

    ./spacedolphin

Control your flight with the arrow keys so that you can knock objects around
the screen. Go nuts with it! :)
