Pre-build Instructions:

SDL, SDL_gfx, git and CMake need to be installed to build and run this game.
The following command will install these packages for you in an apt-based
packaging system, used by many distros of GNU/Linux: (Pacakge names may be
different in newer or older systems.)

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev

Next, you need to grab the source code, if you haven't downloaded it yet. (The
clone only needs to be done once):

    git clone git://repo.or.cz/spacedolphin.git

    cd spacedolphin

In the future, you can pull the changes to update the source code:

    git pull


Build Instructions:

To build the game in the spacedolphin directory, run:

    mkdir build ; cd build
    cmake ..
    make

CMake will automatically build and statically link the included Chipmunk
Physics library, without needing to install it.


Game Instructions:

To play the game, run this:

    ./spacedolphin

Control your flight with the arrow keys so that you can knock objects around
the screen. Go nuts with it! :)
